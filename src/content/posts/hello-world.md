# First Blog Post

This is the first post on a blog created using **Next.js** and **Markdown**. In this blog, I plan to write about various technical topics.

## Markdown Examples

Using markdown makes writing content easy. For example:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://nextjs.org/)
- `code`

```javascript
// You can also display code blocks
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Zenn Markdown Extended Syntax

This blog also supports Zenn Markdown extended syntax.
